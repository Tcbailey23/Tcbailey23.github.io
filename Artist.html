          <p>Terreka Bailey is a student working towards becoming a graphic designer and who will be graduating with her Graphic Design diploma in 2021 in the month of November. From there, she hopes to either start her own business or become a part of a great company.

In her younger years, Terreka participated in Sports (Track and Field) as well as doing her part in being an honored member in her high school’s art society. Through these activities she learned patience, perseverance, and the value of teamwork. Terreka always had a passion for art because it gave her something to look forward to everyday. One day, she hopes to create several passive incomes using her skills. She just wants to have an enjoyable career and live a comfortable lifestyle.
