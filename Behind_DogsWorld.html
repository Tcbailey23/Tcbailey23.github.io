    <h1> Why a dog's World?</h1>

      <p> It's a Dog's World was created to share good facts about our best friends. In order to increase awareness of the dogs and puppies that need to be adopted. We also just love to spread good love and to bring love into our lives. Lets continue to work to save these amazing animals from euthanization.</p>
